    Professional Ruby Conference Keynote Notes
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 18 Nov 2008</div>
  <p>Part of my series of notes from the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Professional Ruby Conference</a>. <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2008/11/18/professional-ruby-conference-notes/">See them all here.</a></p>
<p>This is the keynote of the conference from Obie Fernandez. He&#8217;s going over the Hashrocket Way, or how he runs his company. Explaining the origins of the hashrocket logo&#8230;80s rock. Pretty metal. Going to explain how they work&#8230;based on Agile: Extreme programming, scrum, their own experience. Four principles in the manifesto for agile software development:</p>
<p><strong>Individuals &amp; interactions over processes and tools</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Pair-programming. They use 2 people in front of one computer, 2 keyboards, 2 mice. Both people that way can code and can be contributors. More productive despite only one workflow. Why? Less interruptions (Twitter, questions, bosses, etc) A lot easier to continue when two people are working on the same thing if one person needs to take a break. Pair programming is a <span class="caps">SKILL</span> to be learned! Benefits come out over time, not immediately. Need to work at it. Continous code reviews =&gt; produces high quality code =&gt; less defects and problems. <span class="caps">LEVELING</span> UP of knowledge because of working closely with skilled people.</li>
	<li>No interviews. What? No, wait. Phone interviews first. But beyond that, no. Can&#8217;t figure out how they work until you actually <span class="caps">WORK</span> with them. Obviously a bit of a problem&#8230;but they should be able to make it if they want the job.</li>
	<li>Don&#8217;t get too big. He doesn&#8217;t want the company to get bigger than it is. Rails is productive and the team size can stay small because of it.</li>
	<li>Small teams. 2-4 people. Roles can rotate&#8230;generally a designer + a senior person who&#8217;s overseeing + client = sweet spot of 5-7 people for a team. Very self-organizing.</li>
	<li>Everybody together. No one works remotely at Hashrocket. Ever. They have a Guest Star program to bring in people for fresh ideas. They bring in people on short-term engagements. Just bring them in for a week, brings in new blood, excitement, new thinking.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Working software over comprehensive documentation</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li><span class="caps">TATFT</span>. Test all the fucking time. Showing a snippet from Brian Liles&#8217; talk.</li>
	<li>RSpec. Think in terms of specifications. Protection against regression, documentation generated for them in the output.</li>
	<li>Minimum viable product. What&#8217;s the least you can do to get a working site up. Rails Rumble 2007&#8230;powerful constraints, powerful deadlines. Hashrocket builds sites for clients in 3 days flat. How do you do this? If distributed, bring people together in one place.</li>
	<li>Small Releases. Very short release cycles. 2-3 weeks sometimes, but multiple deploys a day for some clients.<br />
#<strong>Customer colloboration over contract negotiation</strong></li>
	<li>Onsite customer. Talk to them face to face and get them to answer the questions. Find a way to make your environment desirable. (You can see the beach from their office!)</li>
	<li>Visual Design <span class="caps">FIRST</span>. They require design documents first. Not exactly an XP practice. They focus on programming not design. Awesome hybrid process graphic&#8230;combines steps from classic waterfall with modern, iterative agile methods.</li>
	<li>User stories are used to define requirements. Narratives about features, with acceptance criteria and relative effort required. Provides a backlog of how long tasks take and leads to better estimation. They use &#8216;storycarding&#8217; to figure out how long features/tasks will take.</li>
	<li>Master Services Agreement. Way more about this on Obie&#8217;s blog. Defines the relationship and business partnership. Legalese. Keeps IP property separate. Keep these documents simple&#8230;(Doesn&#8217;t look that way to me).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Responding to change over following a plan</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Pivotal Tracker. Cornerstone of his business, and it&#8217;s free to try! Shows current features and a backlog of current ones. (I wonder how this compares to Lighthouse!)</li>
	<li>Standup meetings. Literally stand up to keep it short. Phone call every day with clients too. Traditional scrum style standup&#8230;what are you doing, what did you do.</li>
</ol>
<p>One more thing&#8230;<span class="caps">HAVE</span> <span class="caps">FUN</span>! Should be fun since Ruby is awesome.</p>
