    Messaging with Ruby on Rails Notes
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 19 Nov 2008</div>
  <p>Part of my series of notes from the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Professional Ruby Conference</a>. <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2008/11/18/professional-ruby-conference-notes/">See them all here.</a></p>
<p>This is a talk from Blaine Cook, formerly of Twitter. Now he&#8217;s in Ireland!</p>
<p>Building messaging systems is simple. Talking. Mail. Telephones. Messaging helps out a lot with <span class="caps">AJAX</span>. Parallel processing too, especially with technologies like MapReduce. Also important to decrease latency. Definitely important because latency determines context.</p>
<p><span class="caps">HTTP</span> really isnt messaging. There&#8217;s a requester, and a response. Not ideal&#8230;ends up with a system that constantly asks &#8220;are we there yet?&#8221; Also need a specific address for it, and low latency. You want online messaging to be like fedex: deliver straight to your door, not to a mailbox where you have to go pick it up. Definitely needs to be asynchronous!</p>
<p>There are many options to do this online: RabbitMQ is Erlang, but a bit odd. ActiveMQ is more enterprisey and Java-based. Starling/beanstalkd are very lightweight, simple, but not a lot of features. Gearman/TheSchwartz is more of a distributing processing framework than a queue server. cron could be used, but it&#8217;s not designed to handle large numbers of messages. <span class="caps">TONS</span> of protocols too that each use.</p>
<p>The queue server/broker needs to be durable: There needs to be a guarantee if the broker dies that the messages are going to get delivered. Beanstalkd doesn&#8217;t have any durability, Spread not so much in some situations. Obviously durability is very important, especially for some domains (financial stuff). Reliability is important too! Starling works a lot like Mongrel: can scale very easily, works well with multiple brokers acting together.</p>
<p>Another important idea: Safety! If the queue server can&#8217;t finish a job, the job will get picked up by another broker. Starling doesn&#8217;t have this&#8230;results in dropped messages because workers crashed. Very application specific, but basically you need to be able to ensure that the message isn&#8217;t sent twice while recovering.</p>
<p>Blaine recently built and released ActiveQueue. There&#8217;s many different ways to tackle this problem: Workling, Nanite. Probably 15 different queue servers released in the past 2 years&#8230;which is fantastic since it shows that people are using it and it&#8217;s growing. Doing it yourself is possible too. Clients talk to a queue, and workers pull jobs off the queue. Workers talk to the queue, and don&#8217;t forget to throw in some monitoring of the workers &amp; clients.</p>
<p>The future: <span class="caps">XMPP</span> and cross-site messaging. Moving towards a low-latency, addressable internet! Right now, it&#8217;s like checking to see if everyone you know has sent <span class="caps">YOU</span> mail. We can do better than that! Servers need message-oriented backends to deliver message-oriented frontends.</p>
