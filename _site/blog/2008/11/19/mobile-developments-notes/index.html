    Mobile Developments Notes
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 19 Nov 2008</div>
  <p>Part of my series of notes from the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Professional Ruby Conference</a>. <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2008/11/18/professional-ruby-conference-notes/">See them all here.</a></p>
<p>This talk is from Matt Pelletier from Eastmedia.</p>
<p>Going to talk about the mobile world. ~280 million PC sales worldwide. Around 1.2 billion mobile handsets too. The technologies that are in play:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Voice</li>
	<li><span class="caps">SMS</span></li>
	<li><span class="caps">MMS</span></li>
	<li>Mobile Data Services</li>
</ul>
<p>Voice: How all of the telcoms started, obviously. Normal calls. Robots too. Tons of VoIP technologies too: Voice <span class="caps">XML</span>, Asterisk/Adhersion</p>
<p><span class="caps">SMS</span>: Just recently started to surpass the number of voice calls in the States. <span class="caps">SMS</span> has long been used in South Korea/Japan. More <span class="caps">SMS</span> than email there! Mobile Terminated: you send a text message, Mobile Originated: you recieve a text message. <span class="caps">SMS</span> works even during emergencies and when phones are normally down since it wasn&#8217;t originally a consumer service. There&#8217;s no metadata associated with an <span class="caps">SMS</span> though&#8230;just time and 160 characters. Can&#8217;t reply even.</p>
<p><span class="caps">MMS</span>: &#8220;A total shit show&#8221;. Even Apple ditched it and used email. It&#8217;s very carrier specific and abritrary. Hard problem to solve though.</p>
<p>Mobile Data Services: Most sharply rising area that&#8217;s important to businesses. <span class="caps">WAP</span> 1.0 was a disaster. <span class="caps">WAP</span> 2.0 is a trimmed down Web. Trimmed down version of <span class="caps">XHTML</span>. Matt used this for their New York Jets project, which got 2 million hits within 4 hours when Brett Favre got signed. Crazy. The &#8220;<span class="caps">REAL</span>&#8221; internet. is involved here too, sans Flash. Browser War v2.0: MobileSafari, Opera, Android Browser, Skyfire. Tons of apps now too. These used to be controlled by carriers in the US, but it&#8217;s changing. This is being slowly eroded by the App Store and Android&#8217;s Marketplace. App development process is <span class="caps">MUCH</span> better than it used to be, but it really isn&#8217;t the Web. <span class="caps">MANY</span> <span class="caps">MANY</span> operating systems on each phone. The best approach to creating these seems to be hybrid: SaaS, iPhone app consuming a Rails app.</p>
<p>Smartphones are becoming more and more common. What exactly do people want? Twitter/Facebook: talk to each other, find places, search. Americans use the mobile web as an extension of the desktop. Location Based Services aren&#8217;t quite there yet. <span class="caps">GPS</span> is still slow. Not able to figure out exactly where you are yet.</p>
<p>Spot.io: Post online strange stuff you see that&#8217;s location based. Entry points: Twitter, IM, Email, <span class="caps">API</span> with OAuth, iPhone client. They&#8217;re also parsing english to extract the most knowledge. Using a hand written parser since people don&#8217;t write the same on Twitter as they do on the Wall Strett Journal.</p>
<p>iPhone Development: Feels like Rails community 3-4 years ago. Sparse domain knowledge and poorly organized. Apple&#8217;s <span class="caps">SDK</span> has code examples but has a lot of holes and problems. Not many good code conventions, but not that bad given it&#8217;s been out for a year. Apple and Google have squeezed down the multiple layers of complexity to a point where you just have to worry about the APIs.</p>
