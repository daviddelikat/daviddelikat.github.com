    RESTful Possibilities - REST in Rails and Beyond Notes
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 20 Nov 2008</div>
  <p>Part of my series of notes from the <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Professional Ruby Conference</a>. <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2008/11/18/professional-ruby-conference-notes/">See them all here.</a></p>
<p>This talk is by James Golick from giraffesoft.</p>
<p>The Rails community has been outspoken about <span class="caps">REST</span>, but it&#8217;s starting to get a stigma where it&#8217;s associated with only Ruby/Rails/Java. However, that shouldn&#8217;t be the case. There&#8217;s plenty of other uses outside though.</p>
<p>Classic problem in computer science: two computers talking to each other over the network. Typically this has been done with Remote Procedure Call. The idea that you&#8217;re invoking a method on some service. Make the programmer feel like they&#8217;re writing regular old code, especially with <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">CORBA</span>. Stack takes care of plumbing and isolates you from the complexities of distributed programming.</p>
<p>They have some big problems though, especially in today&#8217;s era of computer. Nearly 42,000 lines of code in the <span class="caps">SOAP</span> stack for Ruby. It&#8217;s huge. They create way more problems than they solve. Fail.</p>
<p>The web came around soon after these technologies, especially <span class="caps">HTTP</span>. Fielding described <span class="caps">REST</span> originally: representational state transfer. Absolutely anything can be resource. Used all the time: <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">POST</span>. Don&#8217;t verb the noun though and complicate things.</p>
<p>Rails sought to standardize on <span class="caps">REST</span>. Based around the map.resources and routing system, which helps out a lot. Standardization is <span class="caps">GOOD</span>. New hires can be much more productive because of this. Cheap and clean <span class="caps">API</span>. Since there&#8217;s a standardization at a higher level, powerful tooling is available. Easy and refreshing integration. Ridiculously easy to use it, only a few lines of code to even integrate with Twitter. Even more, this makes happy developers, which can lead to a more profitable business.</p>
<p>Beyond Rails. Building on <span class="caps">REST</span> gets you a free server since there&#8217;s tons out there already, and a cheap client since they&#8217;re already implemented and easy to use. Looking at Starling as an example of this. 24% queue, 76% other shit <span class="caps">LOC</span>-wise with <span class="caps">REST</span>. Going through implementing a queue in Sinatra, which is really quite easy. Building apps on <span class="caps">REST</span> is good since there&#8217;s plenty of servers and clients out there that can easy consume and use the services without a lot of code.</p>
