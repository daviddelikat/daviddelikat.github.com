    Why I love Twitter
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 25 Mar 2008</div>
  <p>I&#8217;ve become quite a <a href="http://twitter.com/qrush">twitterholic</a> the past few days. In fact, let&#8217;s <a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/qrush">check the stats</a>. Yeah, I&#8217;ve been pretty much addicted the past few days. Why? Well, there&#8217;s a few things I love about Twitter:</p>
<p><strong>Twitter is short, sweet, and easy to use.</strong></p>
<p>The concept is simple: 140 characters to tell the world what you&#8217;re doing. I don&#8217;t think you can get more simple than that. No complex forms, no huge commitments, just a simple request, and your simple answer. It has a wonderful web interface, and the settings allow you completely customize your page&#8217;s background along with colors for fonts. It&#8217;s just a breeze to use and easy to look at, which is a welcome change compared to Facebook or MySpace.<!--more--></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s an awesome way to network with highly connected bloggers.</strong></p>
<p>I think <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2008/03/23/the-secret-to-twitter/">Scoble puts it best</a>:<br />
<blockquote>You&#8217;re communicating to the world that you&#8217;d like to be listened to (golden rule: treat people how you&#8217;d like to be treated).</blockquote></p>
<p>Twitter is becoming the heart of the <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/interblag.png">Interblag</a>. It&#8217;s what bloggers are doing when they&#8217;re <span class="caps">NOT</span> blogging. Obviously yes, we all have our jobs and commitments, but Twitter is a way to connect with those people between their blog, vlogs, or however they communicate with the internet at large. It&#8217;s a way for those who are connected to quickly poll, grow, and comment with their audience. The value to bloggers to be active on Twitter is absolutely critical: these are the people who you <span class="caps">WANT</span> to be reading your blog. They&#8217;re the people that will link your blog to others, they know where to share it and who to share it with. They&#8217;re all here folks. Come and find them.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a great way to keep in touch with friends.</strong></p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddO9idmax0o">Twitter in Plain English</a> hits the nail on head: Twitter is a way to converse with friends in a way that isn&#8217;t that important to email them, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily demands their instant attention. Of course now, you can use Jabber/<span class="caps">XMPP</span> to interface with Twitter. Anyway, I find it to be a neat way to keeping in touch with people I know in the real world online that isn&#8217;t exactly bugging them over <span class="caps">AIM</span> or Facebook.  Also, if you&#8217;re concerned about random people like me following your every move, you can make your page private and only allow those you approve to watch your updates.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s just fun to use!</strong></p>
<p>What really gets me with this are the <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">fantastic</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wittytwitter/">clients</a> <a href="http://www.kosertech.com/blog/?page_id=5">that</a> <a href="http://www.tinytwitter.com/">seem</a> <a href="http://pockettweets.com/">to</a> <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">be</a> <a href="http://itweet.net/web/indexApp.php">populating</a> <a href="http://apps.npike.net/MobileTwitter/">the</a> <a href="http://www.twitbin.com/">net</a>.  The Twitter <span class="caps">API</span> is readily accessible and easy to implement, and that&#8217;s extremely important as it seems that most people use twitter through outside clients or through text messaging rather than their web interface. My personal favorite at the moment is <a href="http://www.twhirl.org">Twhirl</a>, which is an Adobe <span class="caps">AIR</span> client. It&#8217;s got a neat, clean interface and colors are customizable, so I&#8217;m having fun with it. I rarely have to go to the website anymore, the <span class="caps">API</span> is so open that the majority of the functionality is accessible through outside clients.</ol></p>
<p>So, why haven&#8217;t you created a <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> account yet? I guarantee you that it&#8217;ll do nothing but help you get your blog known, and connect with others who are on the same quest. Feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/qrush">follow me</a> as well, I&#8217;ll make sure to follow you.</p>
