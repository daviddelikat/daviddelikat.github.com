    Turning off the Firehose
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 16 Mar 2008</div>
  <p>I recently came across <a href="http://www.philonoist.net/2008/03/14/im-done-with-reddit/">this post</a> about a user who decided he had enough of the user-generated news community, <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>. I&#8217;ve been a Reddit user for a quite some time now, and I&#8217;ve done my share of down voting Ron Paul stories as well submitting silly pictures that have made it onto the front page. Lately though, it&#8217;s become more than a habit to check this site.  <!--more-->I have a very compulsive personality, and I tend to find some sort of deep and intensive joy in small, minute improvements and changes. I know this is the reason why over 70 days of my life were wasted on World of Warcraft, and I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s the reason why I find programming so fun. Most people would be frustrated by missing a semi-colon and be absolutely stumped by the quest for perfection that compilers demand, but to me it&#8217;s another challenge, another hurdle I know I can overcome. It&#8217;s also the reason why some days I&#8217;d refresh Reddit every 5 to 10 minutes to see if my karma had changed.</p>
<p>Reddit has been sucking up way too much of my time during the day, and I&#8217;ve decided to put an end to it. All I did was block it through my hosts file to redirect to 127.0.0.1, which works out well since during my work time it directs me to the website that I&#8217;m developing.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m turning off the firehose. I will probably end up blocking Digg and Slashdot as well, and I need to set up Google Reader for my favorite blogs. Yeah, this means I&#8217;ll sacrifice that information intake that my brain is used to, but I feel that time could be used to read the several books I have lying around my room, be it Code Complete or the Mythical Man-Month. My guitar is also gathering plenty of dust, and I have a few side projects that I could be working on as well. Here&#8217;s to less distractions!  Do you have distractions that you could probably do without?</p>
