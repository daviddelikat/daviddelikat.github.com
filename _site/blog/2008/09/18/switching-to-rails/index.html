  <h2><a href="/blog/2008/09/18/switching-to-rails">
    Switching to Rails
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 18 Sep 2008</div>
  <p>For a while now I&#8217;ve been <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">obsessed</span> working with Ruby on Rails. Rails has caused me to switch from doing .<span class="caps">NET</span>/<span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> development on my desktop PC using Windows XP to owning a Mac Mini and putting Ubuntu on Dell laptop. Obviously, this is a huge change, and I&#8217;m going to explain why I&#8217;ve switched.</p>
<h3>Rails is a combination of software engineering principles and web programming best practices.</h3>
<p>In this respect Rails is a dream: Active Record. RESTful architecture. Built-in xml/json/etc web services. <span class="caps">TDD</span>/<span class="caps">BDD</span> practices. I could go on and on, but all that matters is <strong>writing Rails applications is an enjoyable</strong> <strong>and fun process</strong>. You&#8217;re not writing <a href="http://www.php.net/">scripts for pages</a>, not having to worry about <a href="http://asp.net">the nuts and bolts</a> of creating a site, or <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/ejb/">dealing with painful <span class="caps">XML</span> files</a>. Convention over configuration is a real path to productivity, and it&#8217;s going to take the other competing systems a long time to catch up to the headway that Rails is making on a daily basis. Rails isn&#8217;t the solution to everything, and <a href="http://www.zeitgeist.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/failwhale.png">it certainly has had it share of growing pains</a>, but it&#8217;s being proven again and again as the most efficient way to create data-driven web applications that are very reliable and follow web standards.</p>
<h3>Tools on *nix based systems are a lot better for Rails development.</h3>
<p><a href="http://java.sys-con.com/node/313594"><span class="caps">DHH</span> puts it best</a>:<br />
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The stigma of being a Web programmer still using Windows will increase.</em></p></p>
<p>For me, it&#8217;s not that much of a stigma, but more of a practical issue. The power of the Unix command line combined with tools like Textmate makes development on <span class="caps">OSX</span> and Linux machines for Rails a <span class="caps">LOT</span> easier. The tools on the Windows side are there, but they&#8217;re usually not as powerful and not as easy to set up. Cygwin is piss slow. Most of the non-Visual Studio text editors suck. The command line sucks, and <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2008/03/20/pimping-the-windows-command-line/">I tried really hard to make it not suck</a>. <a href="http://blog.mmediasys.com/2008/03/06/is-windows-a-supported-platform-for-ruby-i-guess-not/"> Even Ruby is slower</a>! All of this pain goes away on <span class="caps">OSX</span>/Ubuntu. Rails would be a lot different if it started on Windows, and I wonder if it would really be the same platform. For now though, I&#8217;m loving the productivity boost that I&#8217;m experencing and trying out different operating systems, and it serves my needs well.</p>
<h3>Bleak future of .<span class="caps">NET</span> development.</h3>
<p>This one will probably get me flamed the most. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like .<span class="caps">NET</span>, it&#8217;s just that I couldn&#8217;t see myself using it any more professionally. I&#8217;m really not a fan of VB.<span class="caps">NET</span>, especially compared to Ruby. It&#8217;s a cruft filled language that <a href="http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2007/11/14/22589.aspx">makes me feel like Mort when writing it.</a> Great things are possible with the language, but the result is so unreadable and ugly that I don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s worth it anymore to use, especially if I can choose not to. C# on the other hand I love and always will, especially over Java.</p>
<p>What scares me more about .<span class="caps">NET</span> is where&#8217;s it&#8217;s going: Silverlight and <span class="caps">WPF</span>. <span class="caps">WPF</span> is supposed to be an awesome new platform that makes it easier for both programmers and designers to collaborate and create great applications.<strong> Seriously though, where are the great <span class="caps">WPF</span> applications? </strong>Why haven&#8217;t we heard as much about them, as say, the newest iPhone apps? I could say the same for Silverlight. Oh wait, the Olympics. ooh, Yahoo Messenger! Whatever. Nothing is going to kill Flash&#8217;s market share.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that things have changed since I was heavy into (bleeding edge) .<span class="caps">NET</span> development 6-9 months ago, but still there seems to be no killer app for <span class="caps">WPF</span> or Silverlight yet. Until that happens they&#8217;ll just suck like everything else. I&#8217;d love to be proven wrong on this point, so if you know of one please show me.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve switched away from Windows or even if you&#8217;ve become a Rubyist/Pythonista in recent times, let me know what your experiences have been. For now on my blog posts will hopefully be a bit more frequent, and will chronicle various quirks and fun things I&#8217;ve found during my Rails journeys.</p>
