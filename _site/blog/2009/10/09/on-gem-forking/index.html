  <h2><a href="/blog/2009/10/09/on-gem-forking">
    On Gem Forking
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 09 Oct 2009</div>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/qrush/litanyagainstfear/fork2.JPG" alt="" /></p>
<p>So, <a href="http://github.com/blog/515-gem-building-is-defunct">GitHub has recommended Gemcutter</a> as an alternative to hosting gems on GitHub. Of course, there seems to be an outcry, for three main reasons that I can see:</p>
<p>1) Effort must be made to move documentation and install instructions<br />
2) Gem forking is not possible with the new site<br />
3) GitHub gave no warning on this</p>
<p>As for #1, you&#8217;ve got a year to update your user base and get gems off GitHub. I&#8217;d assume that any actively maintained project has figured Gemcutter out by then. And for #3, at least we&#8217;ve got a new service that works and can meet the same needs.</p>
<p>Regarding RubyGem forking, I&#8217;d like to state that this statement is <strong>false</strong>. Gemcutter accepts built gems, so you simply need to mimic the actions that GitHub&#8217;s gem builder did: Open your .gemspec up, append your username to the gem name, and save. <code>gem build</code>, <code>gem push</code>, and done.</p>
<p>I think an important distinction must be made here: <strong>gem forking != scm forking</strong>. GitHub made it easy for anyone to automatically push modifications to gems, but there&#8217;s a bigger picture to think of here. Hopefully at some point, the changes you made will be brought back into the mainline gem. As <a href="http://daviddollar.org/">David Dollar</a> so eloquently puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the general idea is that gem forks should be a huge special case. I&#8217;m somewhat of the mind personally that making gem forks too &#8216;easy&#8217; causes a great deal of unnecessary fragmentation in the community. It seems reasonable to me, that if your project is going to depend on a gem fork, that the dependency resolution not be automatic, and your installation instructions can tell the user how to get the forked dependency.</p>
<p>If a fork is going to be long-term, or a true alternative, it should probably be reregistered under a new name as a different project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like I stated above, &#8216;gem forking&#8217; is still supported just because of the nature of how Gemcutter works. I felt there needed to be a longer term solution for this in general, since now the community has grown used to it. This <a href="http://wiki.github.com/qrush/gemcutter/fork-support">lively discussion</a> ensued, and after some deliberation we&#8217;re going to use subdomains in order to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The idea is this: you&#8217;ll be able to register your own subdomain on gemcutter.org, such as <code>qrush.gemcutter.org</code>, and we&#8217;ll give you a completely blank index to push to. Hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to add others like the <a href="http://gemcutter.org/pages/gem_docs#owner">gem owner</a> system works now. I feel this feature needs to be used in the following ways:</p>
<p>1) Subdomain use should be infrequent. It&#8217;s for trial/forked gems that shouldn&#8217;t be relied on for production.<br />
2) Use prerelease versions for development snapshots (version numbers like 1.0.0pre, <code>gem install yourgem --prerelease</code>)<br />
3) Don&#8217;t add someone&#8217;s subdomain as a source, unless you can completely trust anything they toss there. (like, your own for example)<br />
4) Consider gemcutter.org/rubygems.org as the main, canonical repo that you can trust.<br />
5) Start looking into <a href="http://blog.segment7.net/articles/2009/02/04/a-rubygems-github-proposal">gem signing/cert</a> since it&#8217;s <strong>the</strong> way we can really trust gems</p>
<p>Of course, none of this subdomains stuff works yet, but it seems like the best way forward. It&#8217;s also spawning new, awesome ideas like <a href="http://github.com/qrush/gemcutter/issues#issue/91">password protected, private subdomains</a>. If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to the project, please <a href="http://github.com/qrush/gemcutter">fork away</a> or hop in #gemcutter on Freenode to see what&#8217;s happening.</p>
<p>This is <strong>our</strong> gem host now, let&#8217;s make it awesome.</p>
