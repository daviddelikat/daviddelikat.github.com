  <p>This is part of my series of notes on RailsConf 2009. <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2009/05/05/railsconf-2009-notes/">Check them all out here.</a></p>
<p>What killed Smalltalk and could it kill Ruby?</p>
<p>Is Smalltalk dead yet? It was the language that only a few dabbled with in the 70s and also quite a few huge projects written. Why did Smalltalk just keel over? Squeak has become an academic language mostly, no one is doing anything serious in it.</p>
<p>Smalltalk really was the pinnacle of what object-oriented design was all about. There were some good languages around though&#8230;C++ is man&#8217;s language, Java is more of an estrogen language. Objective-C was really influenced from Smalltalk though. Smalltalk had a huge advantage over C/C++ in productivity. Smalltalk also had a lot of powerful <span class="caps">IDE</span> tools, especially for refactoring. But, it still died. It was mostly&#8230;non-hormonal. It makes stuff happen.</p>
<p>Ward Cunningham is pretty much a badass. He&#8217;s come up with or kickstarted tons of great ideas: design patterns, <span class="caps">FIT</span>, the wiki, the list goes on and on and on. According to Ward: clean code is when you look at a routine, and it&#8217;s pretty much what you expected. Clean code has a metric of zero WTFs/minute.</p>
<p>According to Ward: what killed Smalltalk was that it was just too easy to make a mess. This didn&#8217;t happen in C++ because it punished you for creating a mess. Smalltalk didn&#8217;t complain much about this, and messes could pile up fast and without consequence.</p>
<p>Ruby has this same problem. Happens with many projects: it&#8217;s just a tangled mess eventually and you have to dive into the framework to see what&#8217;s going on. Apply the Boy Scout Rule to code: random acts of kindness for every checkout. This doesn&#8217;t happen though&#8230;cleaning code is risky. The messes are easy to make, but hard to clean&#8230;it becomes your mess if you break it!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a way out of this: <span class="caps">TDD</span>! Ruby has this built in, but he&#8217;s afraid that the discipline won&#8217;t grow with the community.  The rules of <span class="caps">TDD</span>:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Don&#8217;t write a line of code without writing a failing unit test</li>
	<li>Not allowed to write more of a unit test when they&#8217;re failing. (Make it green!)</li>
	<li>No writing of production code without writing another failing test.</li>
</ol>
<p>The cycle might seem pointless to those outside&#8230;but it really prevents the horrible timesink that is debugging. Having a test suite really helps with refactoring. Tests eliminate fear! A suite of tests removes fear when trying to change things.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TDD</span> never became part of the culture in Smalltalk&#8230;it has become part of the Ruby culture, but is it enough? Without tests, you are not in control of your codebase. There was a certain air of arrogance in the Smalltalk community that seemed to keep people away from it. They felt their tools and languages were just better, and they ended up building a wall around themselves.</p>
<p>Dynamic languages won the language wars, even the static languages have adopted some dynamic principles. There was a certain lack of professionalism that the community just lacked. Smalltalk died since it just refused to address the general problems of the enterprise: parochialism.</p>
<p>What might save Ruby and Rails, etc from this demise? It&#8217;s not headed in this direction yet. The following must happen to prevent the downfall:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Discipline. <span class="caps">TDD</span>. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">HARD</span>.</li>
	<li>Humility. There are good laughs to be had, but don&#8217;t build the wall (or force them to!)</li>
	<li>Solving the dirty problems. Bad database schemas, for example. Someone&#8217;s got to deal with it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&#8217;t ignore the enterprise.</p>
