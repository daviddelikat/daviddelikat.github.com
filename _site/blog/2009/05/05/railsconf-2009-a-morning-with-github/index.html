    RailsConf 2009 A Morning with GitHub
  </a></h2>
  <div id="date">published 05 May 2009</div>
  <p>This is part of my series of notes on RailsConf 2009. <a href="http://litanyagainstfear.com/blog/2009/05/05/railsconf-2009-notes/">Check them all out here.</a></p>
<p>Introducing the guys behind GitHub, and then going through some QA&#8217;s.</p>
<p>1) Does github use any special techniques for storing so many repos?</p>
<p>Storing repos uses alternates, which shares objects between different repos. They use Grit for a pure Ruby interface to Git. They use RedHat <span class="caps">GFS</span> as a shared filesystem. Lots of caching. No distributed hash table for objects&#8230;yet. Architecture is pretty standard so far.</p>
<p>2) How do you monitor the whole system?</p>
<p>Twitter. No, seriously: NewRelic. There&#8217;s also a job queue that they&#8217;ve written custom stuff to look into what&#8217;s going on. Engine Yard monitors the overall health of the system. They use Tom&#8217;s god gem for lots of monitoring. They have to make sure that some processes don&#8217;t kill the servers, such as syntax highlighting or upload-pack running wild.</p>
<p>3) Do you shard git repos or do you use one big <span class="caps">GFS</span>?</p>
<p>They split up repositories because having thousands of repos in one directory is just&#8230;bad. They use a pretty simple hashing algorithm to split it up.</p>
<p>4) How long does it take the test suite to run?</p>
<p>A few minutes? No one seems to know. They use integrity to let them know when the build breaks.</p>
<p>5) Are they going to open source github?</p>
<p>Cost of running the open source project is really high, they&#8217;re in this to make money. Parts of it are open source: Jekyll, Grit, the services.</p>
<p>6) How many servers do you run GH on?</p>
<p>Hosted at EngineYard. 4 front-end slices, 1 job slice, 1 machine for solr, 1 for gem building. Memcache runs on the front-end slices too.</p>
<p>7) Is the GitHub source on GH?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>8) Is GitHub profitable?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>9) Why an Octocat?</p>
<p>Tom was looking for a mascot when GitHub was starting, and he was looking for octopus style images since Git has an octopus merge. He found some artist that made him</p>
<p>10) How do you manage authentication of so many <span class="caps">SSH</span> public keys on one user account?</p>
<p>Someone from EY patched sshd for them. Patching authorized_keys doesn&#8217;t work well with thousands of keys. So now, it looks up the keys via MySQL, which scales pretty well.</p>
<p>11) When will you offer GH tshirts featuring the Octocat?</p>
<p>Soon, hopefully.</p>
<p>12) Naming gems username-gemname sort of works. How can it be made better?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not very happy with the setup. They had to deal with some people creating accounts like &#8216;net&#8217; and having an &#8216;ssh&#8217; repo. It&#8217;s been an incredible amount of work and a huge hassle so far for them.</p>
<p>13) What can we expect in terms of new features on the upcoming months?</p>
<p>Make sure the site scales. <span class="caps">GFS</span> isn&#8217;t going to scale for much longer. They need to make Git scale, not Rails scale. Git wasn&#8217;t really built to do what they need, and it&#8217;s a big problem that they need to tackle. Better documentation for the <span class="caps">API</span> along with better integration for third party apps.</p>
<p>14) Why not use passenger?</p>
<p>EY manages it. No big reasons to change it yet.</p>
