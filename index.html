<p>What better way to publish to the internet than in plain text html files?
What more could I want than to type into a text box, insert some markup and
push to my git repository?  This way I know that no matter how bad it looks 
the first time I post it, I can fix it to look better by editing the file 
again.  When I'm done editing, I know that unless I specifically try to change
it; the page will look the same every time I look at it. :) <p><hr>
